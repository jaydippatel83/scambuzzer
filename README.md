**The AI Agent That Detects, Alerts, and Protects Crypto Users from Scams üö®**

# Problem: 
Over $2.3 billion was lost to crypto hacks and frauds in 2024, with phishing scams alone accounting for approximately $450 million. These widespread scams have made many users hesitant to transact on-chain, reinforcing the perception that crypto is a scam-ridden industry.

However, knowledgeable and informed users not only safeguard their own assets but also contribute to the growth of blockchain innovation by preventing bad actors from damaging the industry‚Äôs reputation.

# Solution: 
ScamBuzzer is a scam defense platform powered by an AI agent, built to detect, alert, and protect users from falling victim to scams.

# How It Works:
1) Users install the ScamBuzzer Chrome Extension.
2) The extension detects phishing sites, malicious contracts, and impersonation scams in real-time.
3) Users receive instant alerts before signing transactions or interacting with scam websites.
4) Works across wallets like MetaMask, Rabby, and Trust Wallet.

# Browser Extension Features:
**Website Phishing Detection:**
When a user opens a website, if it's flagged in the phishing database, the extension will block access, issue a warning, or display an alert.
**Transaction Security Check:**
When a user signs a transaction, if the contract address is flagged in the exploit contract database, the extension will issue an alert.
**Scam Lookup Tool:**
A search bar where users can paste a contract address to check if it is flagged as a scam or exploit.
 
# Community ‚ÄúReport‚Äù and ‚ÄúEarn‚Äù Mechanism:
Users can sign in using Privy and submit phishing links, contract addresses, etc., via the dashboard.
If the reported entry is not a false positive and has not been flagged already, the community member becomes eligible to earn **Buzzer** points.  

**Bounty Information and integration detail:**
**Covalent** - fetch transaction history, token history etc using Covalent‚Äôs api
 
**Coinbase** - Best AgentKit Contributions: We will build a Scam detector plugin for their agentikit by Scam Buzzer. That plug will have end points that devs can call to check if transactions their agent is going to perform, are legit/scam, etc. 

**Privy:** Provide scam detector middleware for privy to make sure users with social signin / wallet less infra dont interact with scam wallet drainer contracts. 
**Flow** -  Best Flow Plugin to existing AI Agent Framework: Same like coinbase, here we ElizaOS plugin that will check scam contracts of the Flow ecosystem and will help ai agents and end users to stay away from those contracts, stop them from interacting with any of exploited smart contracts by scammers. 

**Base:** Commando Agent token by ScamBuzzer on base. The community can submit scam URLs, and contract addresses to SB and earn coins as per the condition that 1) the Scam should be valid and not a false positive 2) It should be a new scam which should be already in SB scam record database.
