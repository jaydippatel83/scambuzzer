# MVP Architecture Plan for Transaction Risk Assessment Agent (Hackathon)

This plan outlines a simplified architecture for a **Transaction Risk Assessment Agent** that leverages the AI Agent SDK for real-time fraud detection on blockchain transactions. The solution is designed as a minimum viable product (MVP) for a hackathon submission, so the scope is trimmed to core features and rapid implementation.

---

## 1. Overview and MVP Goals

**Objective:**  
Develop a working prototype that ingests transaction data, performs risk evaluation using the AI Agent SDK, and displays the results on a simple dashboard.

**Key MVP Features:**
- **Transaction Input:**  
  A basic interface to simulate or submit transaction data.
  
- **Risk Assessment:**  
  An API endpoint that leverages the AI Agent SDK to evaluate each transaction and returns a risk score along with highlights (e.g., flagged anomalies).

- **Dashboard:**  
  A simple Next.js page where users can view the risk assessment results.

**Out of Scope (for now):**
- Real-time WebSocket alerting (will use simple HTTP requests for quick turnaround).
- Integration with external APIs (like Covalent's or GoldRush) – use sample/mock data.
- Persistent data storage (in-memory handling is sufficient).

---

## 2. Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js (React-based) — Provides the dashboard and transaction simulation page.
- **Backend:** Next.js API routes (leveraging Node.js) to process transaction data.
- **Language:** JavaScript (ES6+)
- **AI Agent SDK:** Mandatory integration for risk assessment.
- **Optional:** In-memory storage (or minimal file-based logging) for viewed transactions.

## 3. High-Level Architecture

The system consists of two parts:
1. **Risk Assessment API (Backend):**
   - Exposes a single API endpoint (`POST /api/transaction`) to receive a transaction payload.
   - The endpoint invokes the **risk analysis module**, which uses the AI Agent SDK.
   - Returns a JSON response with risk score and any flagged issues.

2. **Frontend Dashboard:**
   - A simple UI page with a form to submit or simulate transaction data.
   - Displays the result of the risk assessment once available.
   - Uses minimal styling and polling (if needed) for real-time simulation.

## 4. Component Breakdown

### 4.1. Risk Assessment API

- **Endpoint:** `POST /api/transaction`
  - Receives transaction details as JSON.
  - Validates and parses the incoming data.
  - Calls a helper function (e.g., `assessTransactionRisk(transactionData)`) that wraps the call to the AI Agent SDK.
  - Returns the computed risk score and any alert flags.

### 4.2. Risk Assessment Module

- **Function:** `assessTransactionRisk(transactionData)`
  - **Responsibilities:**
    - Validate/sanitize the transaction data.
    - (Optionally) enrich data with minimal additional context (if time permits).
    - Call the corresponding AI Agent SDK method and wait for the response.
    - Return a simplified risk score and a brief explanation (e.g., "unusual amount", "rapid transfers").

### 4.3. Frontend Dashboard

- **Page:** `/pages/index.js`
  - A React form to input or simulate a transaction.
  - Sends a POST request to the `/api/transaction` endpoint.
  - Displays the response (risk score and details).

## 5. Data Flow

1. **Transaction Submission:**
   - User fills the form / clicks a "simulate transaction" button on the dashboard.
   - Data is sent to the `POST /api/transaction` API endpoint.

2. **Risk Analysis:**
   - The API endpoint forwards the transaction data to `assessTransactionRisk()`.
   - The AI Agent SDK processes the data and returns a risk score.
   - The API sends the risk outcome back to the frontend.

3. **Result Display:**
   - The dashboard displays the risk assessment.
   - In case of a high-risk score, the dashboard highlights the alert for user attention.

## 6. Project Plan and Timeline (One Day)

### Hour 1–2: Setup & Environment
- Set up the Next.js project and structure the API route and frontend page.
- Integrate and test the AI Agent SDK in a small wrapper module.

### Hour 3–5: API & Core Functionality
- Develop the `POST /api/transaction` endpoint.
- Implement the `assessTransactionRisk` function, ensuring it calls the AI Agent SDK properly.
- Hard-code or simulate sample transaction data for initial testing.

### Hour 6–7: Frontend Dashboard
- Build a minimal UI with a form to submit transaction data.
- Display resulting risk analysis on the same page.
- (Optional) Add simple styling for clarity.

### Hour 8: Testing, Debugging & Polish
- Manually test the entire flow.
- Tweak error handling and logging.
- Add basic instructions on the dashboard for demo purposes.

### Hour 9–10: Final Integration & Submission
- Final cleanup of code.
- Write a short README with instructions.
- Package and deploy (if required) for hackathon submission.

## 7. Final Notes

- **Focus on Core Value:**  
  The key is to ensure the AI Agent SDK integration works as expected; extra bells and whistles (real-time notifications, complex data integrations) can be postponed.

- **Rapid Iteration:**  
  Use simple API calls and the Next.js built-in server. Prioritize functionality over design.

- **Testing:**  
  Use mocked or pre-defined transaction data if external API integration is too time-consuming.

By following this trimmed approach, you can quickly deliver a functional prototype that meets the hackathon requirements and showcases a real-time transaction risk assessment powered by the AI Agent SDK.
